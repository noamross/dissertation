# Acknowledgments

I have been fortunate to have many brilliant, patient, and collegial mentors on the way to my Ph.D. My advisor, Alan Hastings, gave me freedom to explore (and discard!) many topics on my circuitous route to this dissertation, and guidance and wisdom in narrowing my scope when it came time to settle on a topic. His vast knowledge, critical eye, and professional support have been essential in beginning a career as an ecologist.

I have greatly appreciated Jim Sanchirico's feedback, on this dissertation and many other projects. Jim's penchant for cutting to the heart of an issue and finding the most critical area to improve has been essential in improving my work, and is a skill I hope to emulate.

Dave Rizzo's mentorship has helped keep my theoretical work grounded in biology and in the real constraints of management problems related to forest disease.  I also thank him for inviting me in to be part of his lab, where I found a whole new community of friends and colleagues. 

My collaboration with Richard Cobb has been a fount of ideas.  The core concepts that motivate this thesis emerged from his empirical work on Sudden Oak Death and our many fruitful discussions about reconciling what he found in the field with the predictions of our models. Jaime Ashander has also served as as a key sounding board for my ideas at every stage.

No one has had more influence on my approach to science as my lab mate Carl Boettiger, now at UC Berkeley. Carl introduced me to the concepts and community of open science, and was a constant source of useful advice and debate. He answered countless programming and mathematical questions of mine over the course of five years.

Sebastian Schreiber and Marissa Baskett have also been wonderful sources of advice and feedback, and their stewardship of the "Teary Group", the weekly meetings of the ecological theory-oriented labs at Davis, provided my core intellectual community.

Graduate school has the reputation of being an lonely slog. The warm, collegial community of the UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology proves it doesn't need to be so. In addition to being a powerhouse of interdisciplinary intellectual activity, the GGE has been a source solidarity and camaraderie. Amongst my fellow students I found inspiration, support, and many lifelong friends. I am grateful to Sharon Lawler, who led the GGE in my time at Davis, for nurturing both the academic and social strength of the group.

Finally, none of this work would have been possible without the support, wisdom, love, and example of my parents, brother and sister: William, Nechama, Jonathan, and Karen Ross.  They have been my greatest mentors as a scientist and as a human being.
