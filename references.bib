  abstract	= {1. Few pathogens are the sole or primary cause of species
		  extinctions, but forest disease has caused spectacular
		  declines in North American overstorey trees and
		  restructured forest ecosystems at large spatial scales over
		  the past 100 years. These events threaten biodiversity
		  associated with impacted host trees and other resources
		  valued by human societies even when they do not directly
		  cause host extinction. 2. Invasion of Phytophthora ramorum
		  and emergence of the forest disease sudden oak death has
		  caused a large-scale decline of tanoak (Notholithocarpus
		  densiflorus) in Californian coastal forests. Here, we
		  describe structural changes to tanoak forests and develop
		  predictive models of infection rates, mortality rates and
		  changes in tanoak biomass and abundance by combining
		  regionally extensive longitudinal field studies and
		  mathematical modelling. 3. Pathogen-invaded stands had
		  smaller average tanoak tree size and higher proportions of
		  large dead tanoak trees compared with uninvaded stands.
		  This pattern is caused in part by a positive relationship
		  between tanoak size and mortality rate, as well as prolific
		  basal sprouting from trees killed by the disease. Tanoak
		  infection, mortality and biomass decline rates were
		  positively related to the prevalence of infection in
		  sporulation-supporting species, especially California bay
		  laurel (Umbellularia californica). 4. We developed a
		  stage-structured and spatially explicit mathematical model
		  including species dynamics and P. ramorum transmission,
		  where the long-term outcome of disease ranges from host
		  extinction when densities of bay laurel are high to limited
		  or no disease outbreak. Low densities of tanoak in a matrix
		  of non-susceptible neighbouring species resulted in
		  slow-enough transmission to retain overstorey tanoak,
		  suggesting host-density thresholds may exist in real
		  forests. 5.Synthesis. Tanoak is likely to persist in many
		  disease-impacted forests via vegetative reproduction, but
		  overstorey trees may be eliminated or greatly reduced in
		  abundance, a pattern similar to other forest diseases that
		  have emerged in the last century including chestnut blight
		  and beech bark disease. Our results support a general model
		  of disease-caused changes to forest trees useful for the
		  analysis of emerging forest pathogens where vegetative
		  reproduction, community-level epidemiology and
		  stage-specific mortality rate interact to determine local
		  disease intensity and host decline.},

  abstract	= {Use of individual-based models (IBMs) has been expanding

		  details at the level of individuals that may lead to
		  different conclusions from aggregated modeling methods.
		  There has been essentially no guidance available on how to
		  most effectively manage populations when the underlying
		  dynamics are best modeled through IBMs. Using a simple
		  resource-consumer IBM, we investigate whether optimal
		  control theory applied to an aggregated model (AM) can
		  effectively control a harmful species modeled by an IBM or
		  whether interactions between individuals, their spatial
		  distribution, and/or landscape heterogeneities limit the
		  effectiveness of a control derived for the AM. If optimal
		  policies derived from an AM are determined to be generally
		  effective in managing a population modeled with
		  considerably greater complexity, this provides evidence
		  that optimal management strategies may be relatively
		  insensitive to the details of individual behavior and the
		  associated effects on population response. We investigate
		  these issues and find that if there is weak spatial
		  heterogeneity in the resource, the optimal control derived
		  from the AM can be used effectively to control the harmful
		  species in the IBM. The approach is more limited in the
		  case of very strong spatial heterogeneity in the resource.
		  This suggests investigation of a mixture of simplified

  abstract	= {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating,
		  within the framework of the stochastic formulation of
		  chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially
		  homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact
		  through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction
		  channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte
		  Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly
		  useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed
		  gas-phase systems in which many molecular species
		  participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For
		  “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and
		  correlations play no significant role, the method stands as
		  an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically
		  solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For
		  nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where
		  fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the
		  deterministic equations, the method constitutes an
		  efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of
		  the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent
		  to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical
		  simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based
		  on a newly defined entity called “the reaction
		  probability density function.” The purpose of this
		  article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation
		  algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner
		  its physical and mathematical validity; numerical
		  applications to specific chemical systems will be presented
		  in subsequent publications.},

  abstract	= {Parasites steal resources that a host would otherwise
		  direct toward its own growth and reproduction. We use this
		  fundamental notion to explain resource-dependent virulence
		  in a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia)-zooplankton host
		  (Daphnia) system and in a variety of other disease systems
		  with invertebrate hosts. In an experiment, well-fed hosts
		  died faster and produced more parasites than did austerely
		  fed ones. This resource-dependent variation in virulence
		  and other experimental results (involving growth and
		  reproduction rate/timing of hosts) readily emerged from a
		  model based on dynamic energy budgets. This model follows
		  energy flow through the host, from ingestion of food, to
		  internal energy storage, to allocation toward growth and
		  reproduction or to a parasite that consumes these reserves.
		  Acting as a consumer, the parasite catalyzes its own
		  extinction, persistence with an energetically compromised
		  host, or death of the host. In this last case, more
		  resources for the host inadvertently fuels faster parasite
		  growth, thereby accelerating the demise of the host
		  (although the opposite result arises with different
		  resource kinetics of the parasite). Thus, this model can
		  explain how resource supply drives variation in virulence.
		  This ecological dependence of virulence likely rivals
		  and/or interacts with genetic mechanisms that often garner
		  more attention in the literature on disease.},

  abstract	= {Samples of Eubothrium parvum were obtained from capelin
		  Mallotus villosus at 55 stations throughout the Barents Sea
		  and from Balsfjord, North Norway. The parasite is
		  distributed widely throughout the Barents Sea, but both
		  incidence and intensity of infection are higher in the
		  regions off Murmansk and the Kola peninsula, and
		  Spitsbergen. E. parvum exhibits a seasonal peak in
		  maturation and probably also in acquisition of new
		  infections. The incidence of infection is greatest in 1 +
		  fish, whereas the intensity is more independent of host
		  age. It is suggested that the parasite requires only a
		  single intermediate host, a plank-tonic copepod, and its
		  distribution in relation to age of host is a reflection of
		  the dietary preference shown by young capelin for copepods.
		  The frequency distribution of E. parvum in capelin was
		  over-dispersed in Balsfjord, where infection levels of
		  between 1 and 28 parasites per fish were encountered in all
		  samples, but under-dispersed in the Barents Sea, where
		  infections of more than four parasites per fish were never
		  found and even infections with three and four parasites
		  were very local. It is suggested that the underdispersion
		  is due to a very low probability of infection in the open
		  waters of the sea. Although the presence of E. parvum
		  cannot be used as a biological tag for capelin, its
		  abundance and frequency distribution can. The difference in
		  frequency distribution and the failure to find any heavily
		  infected fish in the Barents Sea confirm the suggestion
		  that the capelin of Balsfjord form a local isolated
		  population, which does not migrate into the Barents Sea.
		  The differences in infection levels within the Barents Sea
		  suggest the further possibility that there are at least two
		  stocks of capelin there, but this requires further

		  lowest in hosts of smallest and largest size classes and
		  highest in hosts of medium size classes, whereas pattern of
		  variation of prevalence with host age would be either
		  convex or asymptotic. In general, mean abundance and
		  species richness of fleas increased with an increase in
		  host age, although the pressure of flea parasitism in terms
		  of number of fleas per unit host body surface decreased
		  with host age. We found 2 clear patterns of the change in
		  flea aggregation and prevalence with host age. The first
		  pattern demonstrated a peak of flea aggregation and a
		  trough of flea prevalence in animals of middle age classes
		  (Apodemus species and C. glareolus). The second pattern was
		  an increase of both flea aggregation and flea prevalence
		  with host age (both Microtus species). Consequently, we did
		  not find unequivocal evidence for the main role of either
		  parasite-induced host mortality or acquired resistance in
		  host age-dependent pattern of flea parasitism. Our results
		  suggest that this pattern can be generated by various
		  processes and is strongly affected by natural history
		  parameters of a host species such as dispersal pattern,
		  spatial distribution, and structure of shelters.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical strategies are vital in
		  curtailing impacts of influenza and have been intensively
		  studied in public health. However, few strategies have
		  explicitly utilized the weekend effect, which has been
		  widely reported to be capable of reducing influenza
		  infections. This study aims to explore six
		  weekend-extension strategies against seasonal and pandemic
		  flu outbreaks.
		  
		  METHODS: The weekend-extension strategies were designed to
		  extend regular two-day weekend by one, two and three days,
		  respectively, and in combination with either a continuous
		  or discontinuous pattern. Their effectiveness was evaluated
		  using an established agent-based spatially explicit
		  simulation model in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, US.
		  
		  RESULTS: If the extensions last more than two days, the
		  weekend-extension strategies can remarkably reduce the
		  overall disease attack rate of seasonal flu. Particularly,
		  a three-day continuous extension is sufficient to suppress
		  the epidemic and confine the spread of disease. For the
		  pandemic flu, the weekend-extension strategies only produce
		  a few mitigation effects until the extensions exceed three
		  days. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a compliance
		  level above 75\% is necessary for the weekend-extension
		  strategies to take effects.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: This research is the first attempt to
		  incorporate the weekend effect into influenza mitigation
		  strategies. The results suggest that appropriate extensions
		  of the regular two-day weekend can be a potential measure
		  to fight against influenza outbreaks, while minimizing
		  interruptions on normal rhythms of socio-economy. The
		  concept of weekend extension would be particularly useful
		  if there were a lack of vaccine stockpiles, e.g., in
		  countries with limited health resources, or in the case of
		  unknown emerging infectious diseases.},

		  introduced combination therapies (ACTs) for Plasmodium
		  falciparum malaria significantly lower patient
		  infectiousness and have the potential to reduce
		  population-level transmission of the parasite. With the
		  increased interest in malaria elimination, understanding
		  the impact on transmission of ACT and other antimalarial
		  drugs with different pharmacodynamics becomes a key issue.
		  This study estimates the reduction in transmission that may
		  be achieved by introducing different types of treatment for
		  symptomatic P. falciparum malaria in endemic areas.
		  
		  METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a mathematical model to
		  predict the potential impact on transmission outcomes of
		  introducing ACT as first-line treatment for uncomplicated
		  malaria in six areas of varying transmission intensity in
		  Tanzania. We also estimated the impact that could be
		  achieved by antimalarials with different efficacy,
		  prophylactic time, and gametocytocidal effects. Rates of
		  treatment, asymptomatic infection, and symptomatic
		  infection in the six study areas were estimated using the
		  model together with data from a cross-sectional survey of
		  5,667 individuals conducted prior to policy change from
		  sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to ACT. The effects of ACT and
		  other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to
		  mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial
		  data. Predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of
		  infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by
		  ACT were highest in the areas with low initial
		  transmission. A 53\% reduction in prevalence of infection
		  was seen if 100\% of current treatment was switched to ACT
		  in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia
		  was lowest (3.7\%), compared to an 11\% reduction in the
		  highest-transmission setting (baseline slide prevalence =
		  57.1\%). Estimated percentage reductions in incidence of
		  clinical episodes were similar. The absolute size of the
		  public health impact, however, was greater in the
		  highest-transmission area, with 54 clinical episodes per
		  100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100
		  persons per year in the lowest-transmission area. High
		  coverage was important. Reducing presumptive treatment
		  through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number
		  of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted
		  in the lower-transmission settings although there was some
		  loss of overall impact on transmission. An efficacious
		  antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal
		  properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be
		  more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting
		  ACT in the highest-transmission setting.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ACTs have the
		  potential for transmission reductions approaching those
		  achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission
		  settings. ACT partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens
		  with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger
		  impact in higher-transmission settings, although their long
		  term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of
		  development of parasite resistance.},

  abstract	= {As a scientific discipline matures, its theoretical
		  underpinnings tend to consolidate around a few general laws
		  that explain a wide range of phenomena, and from which can
		  be derived further testable predictions. It is one of the
		  goals of science to uncover the general principles that
		  produce recurring patterns in nature. Although this has
		  happened in many areas of physics and chemistry, ecology is
		  yet to take this important step. Ecological systems are
		  intrinsically complex, but this does not necessarily mean
		  that everything about them is unpredictable or chaotic.
		  Ecologists, whose grand aim is to understand the
		  interactions that govern the distribution, abundance and
		  diversity of living organisms at different scales, have
		  uncovered several regular patterns, i.e. widely observable
		  statistical tendencies, in the abundance or diversity of
		  organisms in natural ecosystems. Some of these patterns,
		  however, are contingent, i.e. they are only true under
		  particular circumstances; nevertheless, the broad
		  generality of many patterns hints at the existence of
		  universal principles. What about parasite ecology: is it
		  also characterized by recurring patterns and general
		  principles? Evidence for repeatable empirical patterns in
		  parasite ecology is reviewed here, in search of patterns
		  that are consistently detectable across taxa or
		  geographical areas. The coverage ranges from the population
		  level all the way to large-scale patterns of parasite
		  diversity and abundance (or biomass) and patterns in the
		  structure of host-parasite interaction networks. Although
		  general laws seem to apply to these extreme scales of
		  studies, most patterns observed at the intermediate scale,
		  i.e. the parasite community level, appear highly contingent
		  and far from universal. The general laws uncovered to date
		  are proving valuable, as they offer glimpses of the
		  underlying processes shaping parasite ecology and
		  diversity.},

		  explicitly. Most changes to the variables are an
		  approximate solution to a trust region subproblem, using
		  the current quadratic model, with a lower bound on the

@Article{	  Yang2011,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The transmission of infectious disease amongst
		  the human population is a complex process which requires
		  advanced, often individual-based, models to capture the
		  space-time details observed in reality.
		  
		  METHODS: An Individual Space-Time Activity-based Model
		  (ISTAM) was applied to simulate the effectiveness of
		  non-pharmaceutical control measures including: (1)
		  refraining from social activities, (2) school closure and
		  (3) household quarantine, for a hypothetical influenza
		  outbreak in an urban area.
		  
		  RESULTS: Amongst the set of control measures tested,
		  refraining from social activities with various compliance
		  levels was relatively ineffective. Household quarantine was
		  very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and
		  total number of cases, with large differences between
		  compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a
		  decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to
		  around 158 for a 100\% compliance level, a decrease of
		  about 48.7\%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to
		  17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of
		  3635-5403, that is, 63.7\%-94.7\% of the baseline value.
		  When coupling control measures, household quarantine
		  together with school closure was the most effective
		  strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of
		  infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB)
		  suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst
		  children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity
		  analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier
		  implementation of control measures leads to greater
		  efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic
		  reproduction number, the effectiveness of
		  non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Simulated results showed that household
		  quarantine was the most effective control measure, while
		  school closure and household quarantine implemented
		  together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models
		  should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of
		  control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a
		  range of settings given sufficient information about the
		  given case and knowledge about the transmission processes
		  at a fine scale.},
